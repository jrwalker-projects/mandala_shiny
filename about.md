Not sure where to start? 
 - turn on **morph**ing and redraw the image.
 - select a different color palette

**Iterations** greatly increases response time and the number of polygons

**Points** - number of points on each circle altering the shape

**Area** means the colors based on polygon area (otherwise distance from center)

**Reverse** flips the order of the colors

You can save the image you make. On Windows seems like you'll need to rename the file with the ".gif" extension
